                    <p class=" textDecreption text-justify ">In 2003, OceanGate entered the market with a single product. Founders John Tu and David Sun solved the critical shortage of surface-mounted memory chips with a memory module that would redefine standards in the memory industry in the years that followed.
                        Combining one of the most comprehensive and rigorous testing processes in the memory industry, a rare 24/7 toll-free technical support center and a consistent introduction of innovative technologies, Kingston Technology has consistently set industry standards for quality and reliability throughout its history.
                        Reliability is a cornerstone of Oceangate's product strategy. This factor plays an important role in maintaining long-term relationships developed over many years with customers. Oceangate remains committed to moving beyond memory industry standards with new developments, while maintaining the signature reliability of its products.
