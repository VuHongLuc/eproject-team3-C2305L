        <p>Set administrator password</p>
        <p>Next, you will create and confirm an Administrator password. This password must be at least 6 characters long and can include numbers, letters, and spaces.</p>
        <p>Enter the password using the keyboard on the touch screen of the VP80ES. You can press the ABC or 123 button to switch between the alphabetic keyboard and the numeric keyboard.</p>
        <p>Confirm your password by tapping the check mark.</p>

        <p>After setting an Administrator password, you can use VP80ES to store and access important files. You can also set the removable SSD to 'read-only' mode by tapping the globe icon to access language options or tapping the gear icon to change advanced settings (such as adding a user password).</p>

        <h3>Connect VP80ES to your System</h3>
        <p>After plugging in the VP80ES, connect this device to your system by pressing the "Connect" button on the screen. A new screen will appear on the VP80ES, and the currently connected system will have a storage drive named KINGSTON available. When you want to disconnect, press the Lock and Disconnect button to safely remove the drive.</p>

        <p>That's it! Once you've set up the IronKey Vault Privacy 80 removable SSD, you can begin safely saving and securing important data.</p>
